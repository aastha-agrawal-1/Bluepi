1. This notebook deals with handling .xlsx files attachments from the emails.
2. In this, connection to IMAP server and the email account is established using imaplib package of python.
3. Then the xlsx files from the unread emails are downloaded into a temporary directory (made using tempfile package)
   and the converted into csv files using pandas.
4. After conversion, the csv file is uploaded in the s3 bucket using boto3 and the temporary directory is removed.
5. One thing to know that this code works fine on local machine but can have compatiblity issues when deploying on
   AWS services because of pandas package. Hence, it is advised not to use pandas package when deploying on AWS and
   try to download files in the AWS temp folder.
6. There are several logic to do the same task and downloading files two times can be reduced to only one time.
